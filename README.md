# Redirect URL Repository

This repository is designed to create a simple redirect URL using GitHub Pages. By hosting an HTML file on GitHub Pages, you can redirect users to any specified destination URL.

## How to Set Up the Redirect

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redirect-url.git
   cd redirect-url
   ```

2. **Edit the `index.html` File**:
   - Open `index.html` in your favorite text editor.
   - Replace `https://yourdestinationurl.com` with the URL you want to redirect to.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=https://yourdestinationurl.com">
       <title>Redirecting...</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <p>If you are not redirected, <a href="https://yourdestinationurl.com">click here</a>.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   ```sh
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Set up redirect URL"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Under "Source," select the main branch and click "Save".
   - GitHub Pages will provide a URL for your site, typically `https://yourusername.github.io/redirect-url`.

5. **Access the Redirect URL**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub Pages URL provided (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/redirect-url`).
   - This URL will now redirect to the destination URL you specified in the `index.html` file.

## Example

If you want to redirect to `https://www.example.com`, your `index.html` file should look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=https://www.example.com">
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>If you are not redirected, <a href="https://www.example.com">click here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
